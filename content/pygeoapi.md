description: Pygeoapi is a Python server implementation of the OGC API suite of standards which provides the capability to deploy a RESTful OGC API endpoint using OpenAPI, GeoJSON, and HTML. This allows us to easily create custom Python geoprocesses/workflows and subsequently make them available through a public API using industry standards.
